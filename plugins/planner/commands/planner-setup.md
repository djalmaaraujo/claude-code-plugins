**CRITICAL: You MUST use the Skill tool to invoke `planner:planner-setup`.**

DO NOT search for files. DO NOT read config files. DO NOT check if planner is already set up.

IMMEDIATELY call the Skill tool with:
- skill: "planner:planner-setup"
- args: "$ARGUMENTS"

The skill will handle everything including asking configuration questions.
